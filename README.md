This repository is an overview of what you need to learn penetration testing and a collection of hacking tools, resources, and references to practice ethical hacking. Most of the tools are UNIX compatible, free and open source.

## Before you start

- If you're new to information security, forget everything you know about hacking.
- Don't start using tools without reading about pen testing and how it works (see [Additional resources](#additional-resources) section).
- Don't download or use tools you haven't audited the code.
- Don't use these tools to do stupid things like investigating/hacking without consent on your friends, or worst, your recruiter.
- Read books, manuals, articles, be curious and not just a [scritpt kiddie](https://www.wikihow.com/Avoid-Becoming-a-Script-Kiddie).
- I wish you don't use these tools for illegal purposes, but if you do, I sure hope you know what you're doing.

# Introduction

## What is penetration testing?

Penetration testing is a type of security testing that is used to test the insecurity of an application. It is conducted to find the security risk which might be present in the system.

If a system is not secured, then any attacker can disrupt or take authorized access to that system. Security risk is normally an accidental error that occurs while developing and implementing the software. For example, configuration errors, design errors, and software bugs, etc. [Learn more](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/penetration_testing/penetration_testing_quick_guide.htm)

## Want to become a penetration tester?

Know about risks on the internet and how they can be prevented is very useful. Especially as a developer. Web hacking and penetration testing is the v2.0 of self-defense! But does know about tools and how to use them is really all you need to become a pentester? Surely not. A real penetration tester must be able to proceed rigorously and detect the weaknesses of an application. He must be able to identify the technology behind and test every single door that might be open to hackers.

This repository aim first to establish a reflection method on penetration testing and explain how to proceed to secure an application. And secondly, to regroup all kind of tools or resources pen testers need. **Be sure to know basics of programming languages and Internet security before learning pen-testing.**

Also, this is important to inform yourself about the law and what you are allowed to do or not. According to your country, computer laws are not the same. First, check laws about privacy and surveillance : [Nine eyes countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes#Other_international_cooperatives), [Five eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes) and Fourteen Eyes. Always check if what you're doing is legal. Even when it's not offensive, information gathering can also be illegal!

# Some vocabulary

**Infosec** : Information security, which is the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. The information or data may take any form, e.g. electronic or physical. Infosec can also be a person who practices ethical security. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security)

**Opsec** : Operations security, which is a process that identifies critical information to determine if friendly actions can be observed by enemy intelligence, determines if information obtained by adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly critical information. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security)

**Black/grey/white hat hacker** : Someone who uses bugs or exploits to break into systems or applications. The goal and the method differ depending on if he's a black, grey or white-hat hacker. A black hat is just someone malicious that does not wait for permission to break into a system or application. A white hat is *usually* a security researcher who practices ethical hacking. A grey hat is just in the middle of these two kinds of hackers, he might want to be malicious if it can benefit (data breach, money, whistleblowing ...).

**Red team** : According to Wikipedia, a red team or the red team is an independent group that challenges an organization to improve its effectiveness by assuming an adversarial role or point of view. It is particularly effective in organizations with strong cultures and fixed ways of approaching problems. The United States intelligence community (military and civilian) has red teams that explore alternative futures and write articles as if they were foreign world leaders. Little formal doctrine or publications about Red Teaming in the military exist. In infosec exercises, Red teamers are playing the role of attackers. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team)

**Blue team** : A blue team is a group of individuals who perform an analysis of information systems to ensure security, identify security flaws, verify the effectiveness of each security measure, and to make certain all security measures will continue to be effective after implementation. As a result, blue teams were developed to design defensive measures against red team activities. In infosec exercises, Blue teamers are playing the role of defenders. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security))

**Penetration tester** : An ethical hacker who practice security, test applications and systems to prevent intrusions or find vulnerabilities.

**Security researcher** : Someone who practice pen testing and browse the web to find phishing/fake websites, infected servers, bugs or vulnerabilities. He can work for a company as a security consultant, he is most likely a Blue teamer.

**Reverse engineering** : Reverse engineering, also called back engineering, is the process by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object. Similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is about a natural phenomenon. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering)

**Social engineering** : In the context of information security, it refers to psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. A type of confidence trick for information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional "con" in that it is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud scheme. The term "social engineering" as an act of psychological manipulation of a human, is also associated with the social sciences, but its usage has caught on among computer and information security professionals. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security))

**Threat analyst** : A threat hunter, also called a cybersecurity threat analyst, is a security professional or managed service provider (MSP) that proactively uses manual or machine-assisted techniques to detect security incidents that may elude the grasp of automated systems. Threat hunters aim to uncover incidents that an enterprise would otherwise not find out about, providing chief information security officers (CISOs) and chief information officers (CIOs) with an additional line of defense against advanced persistent threats (APTs). [SearchCIO](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/threat-hunter-cybersecurity-threat-analyst)

# Difference between hacking and ethical hacking

A black hat is practicing penetration testing, but unlike a white hat, this is not ethical hacking. Ethical hacking is about finding vulnerabilities and improve the security of a system. An ethical hacker is an ultimate security professional. Ethical hackers know how to find and exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses in various systems, just like a malicious hacker (a black hat hacker). In fact, they both use the same skills; however, an ethical hacker uses those skills in a legitimate, lawful manner to try to find vulnerabilities and fix them before the bad guys can get there and try to break in. An ethical hacker is basically a white hat hacker.
